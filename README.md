# Thread-race
This is a small C program that simulates a race between 2 or more objects, each object is a thread and all threads happen concurently

Please read READEME.txt file for more instructions.

These codes are for view purpose only, do not copy it since I do not consent :)


In the video I attached below, there are 4 runners.
- Each runner will make a 3-step forward 1-step back randomly (sort-of)
- There will be obstacles (little 'd') going from the opposite direction, they will go left-right randomly
- When the runner collides with an obstacle, they will lost HP (they also lose HP from moving)
- The race ends when all runners are dead.
